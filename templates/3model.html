    <h2>Considerations</h2>
    <p style="margin-left:1cm; margin-right:1cm;" align="left">Our risk model uses the classifier method to narrow contributing factors with high feature 
        importance for COVID-19 mortality predictions. The contributing factors are narrowed to age, gender, 
        and the top 6 features of each category in pre-existing conditions and symptoms. </p>
    <p style="margin-left:1cm; margin-right:1cm;" align="left">Logistic regression model is applied which shows an accuracy score of 0.88. Although the low-risk population f1-score 
    is 92%, the high risk population f1-score is only 66%, showing higher precision and recall for 
    low rather than high risk populations. </p>
    <p style="margin-left:1cm; margin-right:1cm;" align="left">The confusion matrix shows that the logistic regression model is able to accurately identify 87.5% ((75% true low risk 
    = predicted low risk) + (12.5% true high risk = predicted high risk)) of its test data into their respective risk categories which show 
    strong predictive capabilities.
