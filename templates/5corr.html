    <p style="margin-left:1cm; margin-right:1cm;" align='left'>To observe any correlation between pre-existing conditions and symptoms, 
        we used matplotlib and seaborn to create a correlation matrix for each feature. Higher correlation is 
        noted in patient populations with underlying combinations of COPD/lung disease and diabetes or COPD/lung
        disease and chronic kidney disease. Within the hypertension feature, there was a higher association with shortness of 
        breath followed by fatigue. Fever and cough symptoms were correlated as well as cough and diarrhea.
